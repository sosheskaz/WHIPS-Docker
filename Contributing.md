# Contributing

## Issues

If you have an issue, feel free to create one in the issues tab.

## Changes

Fork the repo, make changes, and make a pull request. In the pull request, include:

- What changes are you making?
- Why?
- How can I verify that your changes work?

## Needed Modifications

- Optimization. The Dockerfile could definitely be optimized to install more efficiently and use
  less space.
- Updates. Updating software versions doesn't hurt, but it can also introduce instability.
- Conda audit. Are there any unneeded conda packages installed? Any more needed?
- Tests. Programmatic tests to make sure that WHIPS is working correctly would make it easier to
  make changes.
- If there are any outstanding issues, try to triage them and/or work out changes in a pull
  request.
- Documentation. If it would be helpful to you, it'll be helpful to someone else.
